# Inline Skating Wearable
Wearable to measure the inline skating posture and provide feedback.

## Code
The code is written in Arduino. It takes the values of the Intertial Measurement Units to determine the knee angle and the posture of the back. 
If the knee angle is wrong (too high), feedback is given to the legs. 
If the posture of the back is hollow instead of round, feedback is given to the middle back. 
If the skater is doing everything correct, the skater gets a "pat on the shoulder" from a vibration motor located on the shoulder.
